### Chapter 3 - National Football League (NFL)

The NFL has long used technology to improve the game and safety of its players. From regular helmet improvements to big data play predictions to radio communications between players and coaches, there are many different technologies in use for each practice and game.

Some NFL stadiums have roofs and provide an indoor experience that is predictable and climate controlled, similar to other sports like the NBA. Many NFL stadiums are not covered and are subject to current weather conditions such as rain, snow and low temperatures, as the NFL season starts in the fall and runs through the winter. This winter weather can severely affect the game and determine the technology used during a game.

## Video, Audio & Photography

In 1920 the NFL was founded and later in 1960 the American Football Leage was founded. They merged in 1966 and became the most popular sports leagues in the United States. Soon after the merger, the 'AFL-NFL World Championship Game' (later renamed Super Bowl) has been broadcast on TV every year since then, leading to numerous video, audio and photograpy advancements.

TV sales also increase in the weeks leading up to the big game, with customers buying bigger and better TV sets, thus demanding more from the people and technology capturing the events in and around the stadium.

### Skycam

Skycam is a company provides what could be called a 'video game view' or 'bird's eye view' of the events happening on the field. Steel cables are run from four points, with computers controlling the pulley system. Multiple people control the camera location, direction and focus of the moving camera.

Some may ask, why not use a drone for the aeral shots? There are a few reasons: 1) the drone would create noise and be a distraction for the players on the field, while the Skycam is nearly silent 2) the weight limits for a drone would not support the high quality camera that Skycam uses, 3) the drone would be subject to wind, while the Skycam cable system is not (up to a certain wind speed), 4) power requirements for a drone means that batteries would need to be swapped out (or a backup drone would need to be deployed), 5) safety for those on the field and reliability - a drone could malfunction or because it's wirelessly connected lose contact with its operator, while Skycam is hard-wired for power and data and can operate for the entire game including overtime without any concerns for power or lost signals.

### Control Room

I takes between 150 and 200 team neutral people to broadcast an NFL game. From cameramen, statiticians, stage managers, runners, technical directors, audio mixers, audio and video technicians all work together to provide the tools that producers and directors need to tell the story to the fans in the stadium and at home.

Many of the people running the broadcast are employed by the TV network (Fox Sports is one example).

Not everything related to the broadcast happens in the stadium's control room. Mobile control rooms for sound and video in a tractor-trailer are delivered and set up days before the big game. Many of these mobile stations are also used for other sports during the NFL offseason.

### On Field Cameras

The NFL allows the broadcaster to have one mobile camera on the field between plays. This portable camera is wirelessly connected to a receiver and mounted on a gimbal. This rig is commonly used after a big play like a touchdown to get a close up of the players and their celebration in the end zone.

The orange pylons on the first down markers and also mark the end zone have cameras that are used for capturing video near ground level. The pylon cameras are frequently used in replay scenarios.

Fixed high-definition cameras are normally placed on the 50 and 22 yard lines. Additional cameras are placed on the field and in numerous other places in the stadium, depending on the network and expected number of at home viewers. Monday night football games have fewer viewers and may only have 20 or so cameras, while playoff games and the Super Bowl may have 2 or 3 times that number.

### On Field Graphics

For TV viewers, additional on-field graphics enhance the real time play experience. It's so common to see the line of scrimmage and first down line that TV viewers would be lost without them. The field grass outside of the line of scrimmage and the first down line is also occasionally  greyed out to highlight the remaining yardage for a first down.

### Sidelines

On the sideline, coaches want to see a bird's eye view of the last play. In the early days, polaroid photos were taken from up above and dropped to the sidelines via a pulley system. Later, images were taken from the same strategic positions in the stands then printed on the sidelines using thermal paper. This paper is subject to hot and cold temperatures and wouldn't work so well during a game played on a hot August day or a cold December night. The next advancement came with a Microsoft contract. Named the 'Microsoft Surface Sideline Viewing System', a platform was developed to take high definition photos, store those photos on servers located at the stadium, categorize them and make them instantly available to coaches and players on the sidelines. Coaches in the coache's booth can annotate photos which are simultaneously updated on the Microsoft Surface tablets on the sidelines.

### Instant Replay

Back in 1976 officials started to look at reviewing questionalble plays. At the time, they determined that there weren't enough cameras to get enough angles (12 cameras was determined to be the minimum amount). The cost to upgrade camera and network equipment in each stadium at the time was considered to be too expensive.

In 1985 the league started testing a new system during the preseason - one that was mostly run from a booth with access to all of the camera feeds and VCRs. After reviewing the plays, the replay official in the booth relayed the info to the officials on the field via walkie talkies.

Walkie-talkies were soon replaced with pagers and radio headsets and changed terminology used on the field after a Kansas City Chiefs vs Oakland Raiders game in October 1986 where the replay official reviewed a touchdown pass and stated "Pass incomplete". The official on the field heard "Pass is complete" and the Raiders won the game because of that call. The terminology was also changed - "confirmed" and "reversed" would be used to remove the ambiguity.

After six seasons in 1991 a majority of team owners voted against keeping the replay system stating concerns such as replays were causing too much delay and the resulting calls were overturned incorrectly.

## Sound

Sound is often an overlooked part of the consumer's experience because of all of the visual stimuli during an NFL game. Also, 100,000 cheering fans in the stadium can make it hard even for the players on the field to hear everything that's going on.

Sometimes during a replay you will catch a glimpse of a microphone operator standing near the line of scrimmage. Some of these operators are holding a parabolic microphone dish. These dishes are designed to concentrate the sounds during a play, including the quarterback's cadence, the grunts and collisions of helmets and shoulder pads after the ball is snapped.

NFL rules allow a single player on each team to wear a helmet that has a built-in radio that allows the player to hear plays called from the sidelines. The radios are one way - the player can only hear, and it's common for them to use hand gestures to communicate back to the sideline. Each radio helmet has a green dot on the back so that the referees are aware of which player is in communication with the sideline.

## Statistics

Like other sports, each NFL game is a treasure trove of statistical data. With 22 players on the field and each game averaging over 150 plays, from the movement of the ball to the field goal distance, to the number of rushing yards per play and per player.

Statistical data drives nearly all of the decisions made by coaches and managers. This data is also available in real-time to the announcers, as you will sometimes hear them talk about a player's seasonal rushing yards or sacks as the game progresses.

## Big Data

The day after a game, each team gets a data dump of all of the data collected from the previous day's games. Each team employs one or more analysts whose job it is to mine and process that data for their club's benefit.

This data can be synced with other sources, such as video and audio to put them back inside every movement of the ball for a thorough analysis of every play.

## Uniforms

NFL uniforms undergo regular revisions to make the sport safer. Regular testing of existing and new helmet data combined with health and concussion data is used to adjust the approved equipment list on a yearly schedule. Shoulder, thigh and knee pads are required during every play to protect players.

### Helmets

Each year, the NFL and the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) work with experts and testing laboratories to test the wide variety of helmets and rank each model according to its ability to reduce concussions. Each year a particular helmet brand's model can be moved up or down the scale of better performance down to not recommended to prohibited.

NFL rule changes have also reduced the number of concussions on the field. Targeting is a rule that was introduced just a few years ago which prohibits a player from lowering their head to use their helmet to make contact with their opponent, and usually involves helmet to helmet conctact. Helmet contact can cause neck, head and spinal injuries. Better helmet technology can help, but rules and penalties can also help reduce player injuries.

### On Field Tracking

Each shoulder pad now has an embedded RFID tag that transmits its location and sensors placed strategically in various locations throught the stadium. The data is collected and triangulation is used to track not only the location and speed of each player, but because each has a left and right RFID tag, the direction of each player.

Each football in use in a game now has a 4 gram RFID tag that is used to track it's location, revolutions per minute (RPM), height and velocity during every play. Now that the football is tracked, miles per hour (MPH) is a stat that is tracked for every game.
