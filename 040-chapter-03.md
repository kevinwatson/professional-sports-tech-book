### Chapter 3 - National Football League (NFL)

The NFL has long used technology to improve the game and safety of its players. From regular helmet improvements to big data play predictions to radio communications between players and coaches, there are many different technologies in use for each practice and game.

## Video, Audio & Photography

In 1920 the NFL was founded and later in 1960 the American Football Leage was founded. They merged in 1966 and became the most popular sports leagues in the United States. Soon after the merger, the 'AFL-NFL World Championship Game' (later renamed Super Bowl) has been broadcast on TV every year since then, leading to numerous video, audio and photograpy advancements.

TV sales also increase in the weeks leading up to the big game, with customers buying bigger and better TV sets, thus demanding more from the people and technology capturing the events in and around the stadium.

### Skycam

Skycam is a company provides what could be called a 'video game view' or 'bird's eye view' of the events happening on the field. Steel cables are run from four points, with computers controlling the pulley system. Multiple people control the camera location, direction and focus of the moving camera.

Some may ask, why not use a drone for the aeral shots? There are a few reasons: 1) the drone would create noise and be a distraction for the players on the field, while the Skycam is nearly silent 2) the weight limits for a drone would not support the high quality camera that Skycam uses, 3) the drone would be subject to wind, while the Skycam cable system is not (up to a certain wind speed), 4) power requirements for a drone means that batteries would need to be swapped out (or a backup drone would need to be deployed), 5) safety for those on the field and reliability - a drone could malfunction or because it's wirelessly connected lose contact with its operator, while Skycam is hard-wired for power and data and can operate for the entire game including overtime without any concerns for power or lost signals.
